      "question": "In Unified SmartConsole Gateways and Servers tab you can perform the following functions EXCEPT ________.",
      "options": [
        "A. Upgrade the software version",
        "B. Open WebUI",
        "C. Open SSH",
        "D. Open service request with Check Point Technical Support"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C. Open SSH",
      "explanation": "The function that can NOT be performed in the Unified SmartConsole Gateways and Servers tab is Open SSH. The Unified SmartConsole does not provide an option to open SSH from the Gateways and Servers tab, as it is not a graphical user interface. The other functions can be performed in this tab."
    },
    {
      "question": "If there are two administrators logged in at the same time to the SmartConsole, and there are objects locked for editing, what must be done to make them available to other administrators? Choose the BEST answer",
      "options": [
        "A. Save and install the Policy",
        "B. Delete older versions of database",
        "C. Revert the session.",
        "D. Publish or discard the session"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D. Publish or discard the session",
      "explanation": "If there are two administrators logged in at the same time to the SmartConsole, and there are objects locked for editing, the administrator who locked the objects must publish or discard the session to make them available to other administrators. Publishing or discarding the session will save or discard the changes made by the administrator and unlock the objects for editing by others [1]."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a valid application navigation tab in the R80 SmartConsole?",

        "C. Security Policies",
        "D. Gateway and Servers"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A. Manage and Command Line",
      "explanation": "Manage and Command Line is not a valid application navigation tab in the R80 SmartConsole, as it does not exist in the interface. The navigation toolbar has tabs for Security Policies, Logs & Monitor, Gateways & Servers, and Manage & Settings [2]."
    },
    {

        "C. Remote",
        "D. Standalone"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B. Bridge Mode",
      "explanation": "Bridge mode deployment adds a Security Gateway to an existing environment without changing IP routing. Bridge mode is a transparent mode that does not require assigning IP addresses to the Security Gateway interfaces [3]."

        "C. Certificate authority",
        "D. Address translation"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D. Address translation",
      "explanation": "Address translation is not a role of the SmartCenter, as it is performed by the Security Gateway based on the NAT policy configured in the SmartConsole. The other options are roles of the SmartCenter, as it is responsible for status monitoring, policy configuration, and certificate authority for the Security Gateways [4]."
    },
    {
      "question": "Secure Internal Communication (SIC) is handled by what process?",
      "options": [
        "A. CPM",
        "B. HTTPS",
        "C. FWD",
        "D. CPD"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D. CPD",
      "explanation": "Secure Internal Communication (SIC) is handled by the CPD process. CPD is the Check Point Daemon that runs on all Check Point modules and handles internal licensing and SIC operations [5]."

        "C. Distributed",
        "D. Bridge Mode"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "A. Standalone",
      "explanation": "A standalone deployment is when the security management server and Security Gateway are installed on the same appliance. This is suitable for small or branch office environments [6]."

        "C. connect virtual IP of Smartcenter HA",
        "D. primary Smartcenter"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B. active Smartcenter",
      "explanation": "The SmartCenter that should be connected to for making changes is the active SmartCenter. The active SmartCenter is the one that is currently synchronizing its configuration with the secondary SmartCenter and handling the communication with the gateways [7]."

        "C. One-time Password",
        "D. Certificate"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C. One-time Password",
      "explanation": "A one-time password is used to initially create trust between a Gateway and Security Management Server. The administrator generates a one-time password from SmartConsole and enters it on the gateway command line interface using the cpconfig command. This establishes a Secure Internal Communication (SIC) between the gateway and the server [8]."

        "D. False, only one administrator can login with write permission."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B. True, every administrator works in a session that is independent of the other administrators.",
      "explanation": "The answer is B because in R80 and above, more than one administrator can login to the Security Management Server with write permission at the same time. Every administrator works in a session that is independent of the other administrators. This is called concurrent administration and it allows multiple administrators to work on the same policy package simultaneously [9]."
